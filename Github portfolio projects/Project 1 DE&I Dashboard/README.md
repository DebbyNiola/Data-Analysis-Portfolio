# Diversity & Inclusion Metrics Dashboard

This project analyzes diversity and inclusion metrics for a company from 2020 to 2021. The dashboard tracks key performance indicators (KPIs) such as gender balance, promotions, turnover, performance ratings, nationality, and age distribution.

## Key Findings

### 1. Gender Balance at Executive Level:
- **2021:** No new hires were made at the executive level.
- **2020:** Only two people were promoted to the executive level, both males.
- By the end of 2021, 84% of executive staff were male, highlighting a significant gender imbalance.

### 2. Hiring Trends (2020):
- 66 employees were hired in 2020.
- Males were more likely to occupy higher-ranking roles, while females were more often in lower-ranking roles.

### 3. Promotions:
- **2020:** 36 employees promoted, 77.8% of them male.
- **2021:** 51 employees promoted, with an improvement in female representation (35.3% female, 64.7% male).
- There was a slight improvement in promoting women to higher positions from 2020 to 2021.

### 4. Turnover (2020):
- 47 employees left, 55.3% of whom were male.
- Performance ratings of leavers ranged between 2.4 and 3 (on a 1-4 scale), while retained staff had ratings between 2 and 2.6.

### 5. Performance Ratings:
- Both male and female employees had similar performance ratings, averaging around 2 on a 1-4 scale.

### 6. Nationality Distribution:
- Over half of the workforce was from Switzerland.
- Almost half were from other parts of Europe, with less than 4% of staff coming from the Americas, Asia, and the Middle East.

### 7. Age Group Distribution:
- Younger employees (20-29 years old) mostly held junior positions.
- Older employees (40-49 years) dominated senior roles, showing an age progression with rank.

### 8. Improvement in Female Promotions:
- There was an increase in female promotions to senior positions in 2021 compared to 2020.
- However, the significance of this improvement requires further analysis.

### 9. General Performance Insights:
- Performance ratings for both genders remained consistent across different roles.

## Conclusions and Recommendations:
- **Gender Imbalance:** The company needs to focus on increasing female representation at the executive level and higher-ranking roles.
- **Turnover Analysis:** A deeper dive into the reasons for turnover, particularly among senior female staff, is recommended.
- **Global Diversity:** Expanding hiring to include more diverse nationalities, especially from underrepresented regions, will enhance diversity efforts.
- **Promotion Practices:** Continuous efforts are needed to improve gender diversity in leadership positions.
